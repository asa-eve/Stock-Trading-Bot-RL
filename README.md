# 🤖 Trading_Bot_RL

Simple system for stock trading using Reinforcement Learning as decision-maker. 

Environment and some functions were modified from library [FinRL: Financial Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL). 

## 🦾 **Project main features**
- all RL algorithms for [Stable-Baselines-3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) are available (including **discrete** and **continious**)
- added algorithms from [Stable-Baselines-3 Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) (PPO LSTM, TRPO, etc.) 
- iterative training feature (for systems with low RAM) with changable seeds
- no requirement for active updates & works with Python >= 3.6
- simple to install & easy run
- ability to choose INDICATORS for training

## ⛓ **Some requirements**
- for datasets - presence of next features with exact names ['date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']

## 🌧 **Current progress**
- ✔ Simple stock trading 
- - [x] Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- - [x] Multiple stock trading


## 💻 Installation and Running 
Download and run 1 of example codes (via command):
```
