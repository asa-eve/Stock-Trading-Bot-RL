# Trading_Bot_RL 🤖

Simple system for trading stocks using Reinforcement Learning as decision-maker. Environment and some functions were modified from library [FinRL: Financial Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL). 

## **Project main features** 🦾
- all RL algorithms for [Stable-Baselines-3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) are available (including **discrete** and **continious**)
- added algorithms from [Stable-Baselines-3 Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) (PPO LSTM, TRPO, etc.) 
- iterative training feature (for systems with low RAM) with changable seeds
- no requirement for active updates & works with Python >= 3.6
- simple to install & easy run
- ability to choose INDICATORS for training

## **Some requirements** ⛓
- for datasets - presence of next features with exact names ['date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']

## **Current progress** 🌧
- ✔ Simple stock trading 
- - [x] Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- - [x] Multiple stock trading


## Installation and Running 👩🏻‍💻
Download and run 1 of example codes (via command):
```
!wget https://raw.github.com/asa-eve/Trading_Bot_RL/main/code_examples/main_iterative_training.ipynb
```
