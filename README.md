# ðŸ¤– Trading_Bot_RL

Simple system for stock trading using Reinforcement Learning as decision-maker. 

Environment and some functions were modified from library [FinRL: Financial Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL). 

Currently **works only with SB3 and SB3-contrib**.

## ðŸ¦¾ **Project main features**
- supports both discrete and continious action space RL algorithms
- restoration of training process (from saved model)
- iterative training feature (for systems with low RAM) with changable seeds
- changable RL model features (INDICATORS)
- RL algorithms from [Stable-Baselines-3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) & [Stable-Baselines-3 Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) (PPO LSTM, TRPO, etc.) are available for usage
- no requirement for active updates & works with Python >= 3.6

## â›“ **Some requirements**
- Datasets
  - column names - exact names -> ['date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']

## ðŸŒ§ **Current build**
- âœ” Simple stock trading 
- - [x] Threshold exploit (risk management)
- - [x] Optuna Tuning
- - [x] Forecasting Model Code
- - [x] Multiple Stock Trading
